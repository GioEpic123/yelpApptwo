---Project Overview----------------


Foodverse
by: Giovanni Quevedo, Grace Park, and Hassan Aziz Elnasri
Yelp database prompted by the coronavirus pandemic to help assist smaller local restaurants
Filters out chains; only shows small local businesses
This app is designed for any user and the way this happens is the app utilizes YELP API, Snapkit authentication, hosted on Heroku, and a group SNAP minis feature allowing users to vote on a restaurant of choice to all visit together.

---UX


User inputs a zip code (or location data) and choose a mile radius 
Price filters($-$$$)
User sees the restaurants in order of distance (By default, this can be changed to price if the user chooses)
User clicks on a listing, and seeâ€™s the listing page which includes:
Name, Address, photos, price rating and recent reviews.
Users will also be able to choose a restaurant they reccomend to start polling on
User will see their bitmoji avatar with their restaurant reccomendation

------Future versions------------------------


Photo gallery and integrate SNAP software so that users can take selfies, picutre of their food choices, or even the restaurant itself and have their review and picture posted to a gallery of the restaurant on our page.
